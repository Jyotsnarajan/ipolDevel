\section{Dispatcher module}
\label{sec:Dispatcher}
In order to distribute the load in several machines, this module is responsible to assign a demorunner according to a policy and the given requirements. 
The creation of those policies is made by the Factory Method, allowing the implementation and assignment of new policies in an easy way.
Until now the implemented policies are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Random Policy:} this policy assigns a random demorunner from the available demorunners list that matches the requirements 
\item \textbf{Sequential Policy:} this policy iterates from the available demorunners list that matches the requirements 
\item \textbf{Lowest Workload Policy:} this policy assigns the demorunner with the lowest workload from the available demorunners list that matches the requirements 
\end{itemize}
