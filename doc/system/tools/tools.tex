\section{Tools}
This section describes the tools available for system administrators, developers, and editors to interact with the IPOL system. Some of their capabilities might clash with the Control Panel (for example, reading and modifying the DDL of the demos in the case of the DDL tool, Sec. \ref{sec:ddl_tool}), but they are useful to perform massive changes or to automatize tasks.
