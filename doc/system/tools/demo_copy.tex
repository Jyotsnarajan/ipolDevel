\subsection{Demo Copy}

The demo copy script is a tool that allows to clone a demo from one environment to another. This tool is useful for development purposes
as it allows a developer to quickly clone a demo to a local environment. The only parameter is the demo ID number in order to copy
everything related to the demo, this includes the DDL, its demo extras, its blobs, and its templates.

\subsubsection{Usage}
By default, the script gets the demo information from the production environment. If the demo is to be copied from Integration the {\tt -i} flag needs to be passed argument.
It will also check if there is a demo with the provided ID number and will ask for another one or to overwrite it.

Some examples:
\paragraph{Copy demo from Production} \hspace{0pt} \\
./demo\_copy.py {\tt <demo\_id>}

By default it will use Production as the source.

\paragraph{Copy demo from Integration} \hspace{0pt} \\
{\tt ./demo\_copy.py -i {\tt <demo\_id>}}

With the argument -i it will use Integration as the source instead of Production.
