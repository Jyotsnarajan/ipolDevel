\section{How to Use it}
This section is the reference manual for using the Control Panel.

\subsection{Status navigation menu option}
The user will be able to monitor if the modules are running and in what machine they are runing.This will be done using the ping or stats ws provided by the different modules.
It's also possible to add tests experiments to the testing demo.
All modules should run under proxy module.

\subsection{Archive navigation menu option}
The Archive module is responsible for storing the experiments made bay users. When a user select a file of his own instead of using ono of the files proposed by the demo, This file is uploaded and used to run the demo bt Demo module, then the result of this execution is sent to Archive module to be stored. Some demos have 40000 experiments.

The user will be presented with a list of demos that have experiments in the archive module, the user will be able to delete these demos from the archive, with all their related info.

When the user selects a demo, he will be presented with a list of all the experiments of the demo (we\'ll use paging), and each experiment will display its information, files included. A user can delete experiments and files. If a file is deleted, all demos that use this file will also be deleted.


\subsection{Blobs navigation menu option}
The Blobs module is responsible for storing the images used as default images for running the demos.
The user will be presented with a list of demos that have blobs in the blob module,
He will be able to remove, add, edit and delete blobs from a demo.
Not ready yet. Partially implemented.

\subsection{Demoinfo navigation menu option}
The Demoinfo module is responsible for storing the information about each demo.
In this module the users will be presented with a list of all the demos stored in the system. For each demo displayed, the users will be able to manage all the information available.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{Add New Demo} 
button allows to create a new demo in the system.
\item The \textbf{DDL} 
button allows to edit the DDL of the selected demo.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demo Dispatcher navigation menu option}
Not ready yet.

\subsection{Demo Runner navigation menu option}
Not ready yet.

\subsection{Proxy navigation menu option}
The integration between proxy and demoinfo is done, but this section remains because it would be interesting to be able to get some stats from the proxy module and present them to the user of the control panel, perhaps not to the editors, but to the admin.
If this functionality is not required, this menu entry should be deleted.
Not ready yet.

\subsection{User manual navigation menu option}
A user manual for the editors that will use the control panel, could be as simple as a PDF link or a help page.
Not ready yet.

\subsection{Demos navigation menu option}
The Demo execution system consists od a Demo Dispatcher module, a Demo Runner module and a DemoInfo module.
Integrated view of the previous sections with the demo system.
Not ready yet.

\subsection{Control Panel users}
The app runs on port 8000, this is configured in settings.py.
To login just access the folling URL, if you where already logged in, it will redirect you to the status page.

\url{http://ipolcore.ipol.im/cp}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Control Panel Admin user}
This is the ipolwebapp project's admin page, 
It offers some configuration options for the project and apps the project uses. The most important, you can add users credentials etc.

\url{http://ipolcore.ipol.im/cp}

\miguel{Explain how to change the admin password for the CP.}

If you somehow delete the ipolwebapp database, you will need to recreate the database, and create all the users from scratch. Django provides a useful command: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,firstnumber=1]
python manage.py createsuperuser
\end{lstlisting}

Run it from the project's directory and create the ipolcpadmin user, 
with this user create all othe accounts.
Remember to run all migrations!
