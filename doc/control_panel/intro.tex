\section{Introduction}
In the modular architecture of IPOL all the modules are able to work standalone since they are servers implementing Stateless webservices. However, a coordinated view from both the functional and administrative point of view is needed.

The Control Panel web application offers a unified interface to configure and administrate the platform. For example, the Editors can remove unused experiments for the archive or add new images to a demo.

At the present moment, the control panel provides a navigation menu option for each module, so you can interact with each module using the webservices they provide.
